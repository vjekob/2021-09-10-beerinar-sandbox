# AL Object ID Ninja Sandbox

This is a sandbox for the launch of [AL Object ID Ninja](https://github.com/vjekob/al-objid) extension
for Visual Studio Code, that will take place on September 10, 2021 at the BC Beerinar virtual event.

## The idea

The best way to explain what AL Object ID Ninja does and why it is a great tool is to try it first-hand.
The most important aspect of this extension is it's multi-developer environment. The idea is that all
attendees of the BC Beerinar download this repo and then use this extension at the same time.

## What do I need to do?

Here's what you should do:
1. Clone this repo:
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/vjekob/2021-09-10-beerinar-sandbox
    ```
2. Open it in Visual Studio Code:
    ```
    cd 2021-09-10-beerinar-sandbox
    code .
    ```
3. Make sure to have the [AL Language](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=ms-dynamics-smb.al)
extension installed.
4. When the demo starts, follow the instructions. In short, you'll create new AL objects. And instead
of using the default auto-complete object ID suggestions from the AL Language extension, you'll use
those from the AL Object ID Ninja

That's it! I hope you have fun with this new tool and make it a permanent asset in your AL development
arsenal.
